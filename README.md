<h4>Advancing women in computing, one line of code at a time</h4>

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we're @bpdc-acmw. We aim to empower women in computing by providing services and opportunities for personal and professional growth. We want to reach out to women from diverse backgrounds and give them what they need to build a strong career in computing and technology. 

Check out the *ACM-W Junior Mentorship Programme (JuMP)* repositories to see what we've been coding.
